### Abstract


The widespread use of smartphones in our daily lives has elevated concerns regarding their security among researchers and practitioners. Particularly, security issues are highly prevalent in Android, the most popular mobile operating system. Previous research has explored various techniques to address these concerns, including the Mining Android Sandbox approach (MAS approach), which aims to identify malicious behavior in repackaged Android applications (apps). However, earlier studies have been limited by small datasets, typically consisting of only 102 pairs of original and repackaged apps. This limitation raises questions about the external validity of their findings and whether the MAS approach can be generalized to larger datasets. To address these concerns, this paper shows a replication study focused on evaluating the accuracy of the MAS approach. Unlike previous studies, our research employs a dataset that is an order of magnitude larger, comprising 4,076 pairs of apps covering a more diverse range of Android malware families. Surprisingly, our findings indicate a significant drop in the accuracy of the MAS approach for identifying malware, with the F1-score decreasing from 0.89 in previous studies to 0.54 in our larger dataset. Upon closer examination, we discovered that the higher representation of certain malware families partially accounts for the increased number of instance where the MAS approach fails to correctly classify a repackaged app as malware. Our findings highlight the limitations of the MAS approach, particularly when scaled, and underscore the importance of complementing it with other techniques to effectively detect a broader range of malware. This opens avenues for further discussion on addressing the blind spots that affect the accuracy of the MAS approach.
